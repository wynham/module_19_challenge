# Module 19 Challenge

This is the repository for my module 19 challenge. In this module challenge, we integrated the Ethereum blockchain network into an application in order to enable customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. 

This application consists of two files: fintech_finder.py and crypto_wallet.py. We import Ethereum transaction functions from the crypto_wallet.py into our fintech_finder.py, which is the main program interface file for our Fintech Finder application.


A customer is able to do the following by using the Fintech Finder application:

(1) Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using their mnemonic seed phrase.

(2) Fetch and display the account balance associated with their Ethereum account address.

(3) Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

(4) Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Kovan testnet.

(5) Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.
